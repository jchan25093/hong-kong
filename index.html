                <p>Hong Kong is an autonomous territory, and former British colony, in southeastern China. Its vibrant, densely populated urban centre is a major port and global financial hub with a skyscraper-studded skyline. Central (the business district) features architectural landmarks like I.M. Pei’s Bank of China Tower. Hong Kong is also a major shopping destination, famed for bespoke tailors and Temple Street Night Market.</p>

                <h3>Seafood</h3>
                <p>The pinnacle of Cantonese cooking is fresh seafood and Hong Kong has a well-earned reputation for the quality of its seafood restaurants. An especially interesting and enjoyable way to enjoy seafood here is to head out of the city and find a ‘seafood street’ — a cluster of seafood restaurants often found along a seafront or near a fish market. The restaurants will often have large tanks of live fish and crustaceans from which you can choose. In some cases, you can buy your fish fresh from a market or off a fishing boat and have a nearby restaurant prepare it for you.</p>

                <p>Hong Kong cuisine is mainly influenced by Cantonese cuisine, British Cuisine, other Western Cuisines, non-Cantonese Chinese cuisine (especially Teochew, and Hakka, Hokkien and the Jiangsu & Zhejiang), Japan, and Southeast Asia, due to Hong Kong's past as a British colony and long history of being an international port of commerce. From the roadside stalls to the most upscale restaurants, Hong Kong provides an unlimited variety of food in every class. Complex combinations and international gourmet expertise have given Hong Kong the reputable labels of "Gourmet Paradise" and "World's Fair of Food".</p>

                <p>Hong Kong nightlife offers a dizzying array of choice. For contemporary art, after-dark shopping, all-night clubbing and high octane entertainment, Asia's 'world city' simply can't be beat. You will be mesmerized by the moves of the Hong Kong Ballet, the Hong Kong Dance Company and the City Contemporary Dance Company, or catch the magical Chinese melodies performed by the Hong Kong Chinese Orchestra. For a change of pace, hit the bars and clubs around Lan Kwai Fong or SoHo and see how the bold and beautiful spend their nights out in Hong Kong.</p>

            <p>The Hong Kong-based Rubão Fan Club and its fans raised $US 100,000 for a statue to be erected after pleas to the government to honour his legacy.[2] A 2.5 metre bronze statue by artist Cao Chong-en was erected along the Avenue of Stars, Hong Kong attraction near the waterfront at Tsim Sha Tsui.  It shows a classic 'ready to strike' Bruce Lee pose, as seen in the 1972 movie Fist of Fury. Hew Kuan-yau, a member of the Bruce Lee Fan Club Committee said, "We want the people to know about the legend of Bruce Lee." The statue was unveiled by Bruce Lee's brother Robert Lee on 27 November 2005, celebrating what would have been Bruce's 65th birthday.</p>
